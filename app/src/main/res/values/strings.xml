    <string name="about_instructor">    Hi, I\'m James. I have a degree in computing from Imperial College London, and a physics diploma from the Open University.I started working for myself at the age of 15, and never looked back. I explored careers as varied as being a commercial pilot, stunt-man, rock climbing instructor, and more. None of these provided a continued challenge, and stable income in the same way technology does.</string>
    <string name="seeMore_aboutInstructor">After building and selling a home computer support business, I became an angel investor and business mentor here in Cambridge UK. I fell in love with teaching game development through one of my investments, and I now spend all of my time sharing my passion with people like you.</string>
